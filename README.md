# React + Vite

This is a React project, its a Dota site where you can see the Characters/Heroes that are currently available in Dota 2 as well as Items, Items Page also has the Search function.
I get the Heroes information from API https://api.opendota.com/api/heroes, and their picture from official steam page, items are also from opendota.com
